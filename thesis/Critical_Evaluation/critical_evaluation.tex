\chapter{Critical Evaluation}

In this chapter (it won’t be chapter 4, but probably chapter 6 or 7 once all the core chapters have been added.)

The critical evaluation consists of a discussion, leading to conclusion.  It is an essential part of a master’s degree.

It shows that you can not only carry out a substantial piece of work, but that you can reflect on it, and think critically about how you might have done it better.

Examiners view the critical evaluation as very important.

\end{center}

Corris Railway, a historic narrow-gauge railway in Machynlleth, Wales, is seeking a web-based application to replace its manual spreadsheet rostering system. A great deal of requirements analysis is required to deal with a wide array of volunteer role types and levels of competency, locations, vehicles, rules, and complex domain knowledge that must be accounted for when producing a timetable and roster of operations. In addition, the software needs to be fully responsive and work equally well on mobile devices, whilst still being fully functional and easy to use by its volunteers.

Railrota is the end result â€“ a full-stack monolithic application developed using the artisanal Laravel framework built for the PHP programming language.

\section{Background}

\section{Motivation}
There are several important motivational factors that ultimately determined the selection of this project topic.

The most important motivating factor for the selection of this project is a genuine, unabated interest in the project specification, the work that would be involved, and the area of computing in which it inhabits. As described by O'Keefe et al, performance in completing tasks and obtaining the most optimal results are characterised when interest is high. \cite{OKEEFE201470} This was also further elaborated in a later online publication that interest allows "people to persist when persisting would otherwise cause them to burn out." \cite{OKEEFE2014WEB}

With a substantial history of working with web applications and Internet technologies throughout academia, within industry, and in personal open source projects, a task to design, implement, test, and deploy a substantial full-stack program with a well-defined set of challenging requirements and technical and organisational hurdles that must be overcome is an exciting prospect, which contributes substantially to its potential success. In addition, as a long-time volunteer with experience donating both time and technical know-how to a range of charities and non-profit initiatives, the experience and domain expertise acquired from operating within those environments, as well as  having extensive understanding of the difficulties and unique challenges presented by volunteer management and rostering respectively will prove highly transferrable and useful throughout the overall system design phase.

Furthermore, this project is intended for real-world implementation and application for the aforementioned steam railway and by its various volunteer workforce; placing it outside the safe confines of a classroom assignment and placing even greater importance on code quality and application ease of use.

\chapter{Reporting on the project -- the core chapters}

Reporting on the project will normally require more than one chapter.
A development project is likely to have chapters addressing requirements, design, implementation, testing and packaging if a plan-driven method is used.  If an agile approach is taking, you might have a chapter for each sprint or iteration.
Other kinds of project will have chapters that are appropriate to the project in question.

You are likely to include diagrams or images in your core chapters.

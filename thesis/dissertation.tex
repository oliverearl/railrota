% MSc Project report / Thesis
% Author: Oliver Earl <ole4@aber.ac.uk>
% 
% This LaTeX template was constructed by Dr. Hannah Dee (hmd1@aber.ac.uk)
% and Neil Taylor (nst@aber.ac.uk) based on the Leeds thesis template and the
% Group Project template for Computer Science in Aberystwyth University.
% I credit it accordingly.
%
% Comments and suggestions of the template itself should be directed to its
% GitHub repository: https://github.com/digidol/MMP
%
% The template is designed to be used with pdflatex and may require modification
% to run with a different LaTeX engine. 
%
% I am using LaTeX Workshop for Visual Studio Code for authoring, which compiles
% my mark-up automatically. You can also build manually by running the included 
% build.sh file. Alternatively:
%
% pdflatex dissertation
% bibtex dissertation
% pdflatex dissertaton (run this twice)
%
% Either will result in dissertation.pdf being compiled.
%
% I personally use the aforementioned extension for vscode to perform word
% counts, but I've included the TeXcount Perl 5 script in the repository to 
% do this if desired. If you run build.sh, it will run this script for you
% after compilation.
%
% Naturally, I didn't write it, so you can find it here:

\chapter*{Appendices}
The appendices are for additional content that is useful to support the discussion in the report. It is material that is not necessarily needed in the body of the report, but its inclusion in the appendices makes it easy to access. 

For example, if you have developed a Design Specification document as part of a plan-driven approach for the project, then it would be appropriate to include that document as an appendix. In the body of your report you would highlight the most interesting aspects of the design, referring your reader to the full specification for further detail.

If you have taken an agile approach to developing the project, then you may be less likely to have developed a full requirements specification. Perhaps you use stories to keep track of the functionality and the 'future conversations'. It might not be relevant to include all of those in the body of your report. Instead, you might include those in an appendix. 

There is a balance to be struck between what is relevant to include in the body of your report and whether additional supporting evidence is appropriate in the appendices. Speak to your supervisor or the module coordinator if you have questions about this.

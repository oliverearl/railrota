\chapter{Literature Review}

The literature review is all about the related knowledge that you are building on.  Similar products and related research are usual.

Remember to use your own words and to show relevance to your project aim.
The literature review will refer extensively to the bibliography. Harvard (author-date) and IEEE reference styles are usual in Computer Science, but the only real rule is that you should use a consistent style.

Refereed articles are generally considered to have the greatest authority, but for a Computer Science project you are also likely to cite other sources, such as technical documents, user manuals, standards documents, web pages and books.

When you cite a web source, make sure to include the date of access.

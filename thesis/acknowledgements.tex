I dedicate this work to my late aunt, Deborah Jones, who tragically passed away in June 2019 during her courageous and tenacious fight against cancer. On top of being a wonderful aunt and akin to a second mother, you were inexplicably supportive and reassuring during every moment of my academic career. I miss you greatly.

I am grateful for the endless support and empathy provided by my colleagues in the Department of Computer Science at Aberystwyth University throughout my most challenging year in academia thus far. In particular to my supervisor Richard Shipman who enthusiastically accepted me onto the project and ensuring that I kept on-target despite initial difficulties, and to Edel Sherratt, who not only was a ready source of wisdom and much-needed motivation, was also willing to tell me off whenever I found myself worrying too much.

Furthermore, I wish to extend a heartfelt thanks to my family and friends throughout the world for their support and words of encouragement. I would also like to thank those who assisted me financially by means of crowdfunding and donations when things looked bleak. I could not have done it without you.

Finally, I would like to send further gratitude to those I have had the privilege to work alongside at Aberystwyth Nightline, Aberystwyth University Students' Union, the Nightline Association, and the National Union of Students. You enabled me to have a positive and profound impact in their lives of my fellow students, and for that I am extremely thankful.

It has been an unrivaled privilege to have spent the majority of the last five years studying in idyllic West Wales, enrolled at a university brimming with history, expertise, and compassion.

\noindent Thank you very much.

\noindent \textit{Diolch yn fawr iawn.}
